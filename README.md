# 👋 Hey there! I'm Devansh Agrawal

## 📄 About Me

I'm a curious and creative Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science** at **The ICFAI University, Raipur**. I love turning ideas into real, working products that solve problems and make life easier.

My main focus is building clean, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using the **MERN stack**, and I’m always exploring new tech like **AI**, **cloud computing**, and **cybersecurity**. I enjoy collaborating with teams, leading events, and constantly learning something new in tech.
